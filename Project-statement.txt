Design and implement the function simulator in c or c++ for subset of ARM
instructions discussed in class. Function simulator takes instruction encoding
in MEM file as input. MEM file has the following format:

#First number is address of the instruction, followed by space followed by instruction encoding. # can be used for comments. For example:
0x0 0xE3A0200A
0x4 0xE3A03000

All the instruction in the given in the input MEM file is executed as per the
functional behavior of the instructions. Each instruction must go through the
following phases:
 - Fetch
 - Decode
 - Execute
 - Memory
 - Writeback

Along with execution of instruction stages, simulator also provide messages
what it is doing in each stage, Implements an additional instruction which
exits the simulator, writes the data memory in MEM file before exiting.  

You must test the software using two assembly programs:
 - Fibonacci Program
 - Sum of the array of N elements. Initialize an array in first loop with each
   element equal to its index. In second loop find the sum of this array, and
store the result at Arr[N].   


A template implementation is attached, which contains a README file, a design
document, Makefile, and c code to start with. In the submission you are
supposed to submit the source code along with updated design document,  README,
input test files.  Overall project would be evaluation on:
 - Functional completeness
 - Documentation completeness
 - Testcase
